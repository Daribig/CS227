## What this class is about
Yes. Just as it's all just bits and bytes, it's all just time series also. This
class will be about modern Time Series Management Systems (TSMS) and the
current research around this area. It will focus on three topics that give you
an overview of the landscape:

1. Time Series Storage: We'll read about storage engines used in industry and and proposed
   in academia. The fundamental problems of time series storage: how to store so much
   data, how long to store the data, and how much of the data store? We'll learn about how
   different storage engines address the problem and compare their approaches, benefits,
   and drawbacks.

2. Time Series Analysis: Given some short time series, can we find the most similar
   segment(s) of a larger time series? We'll take a look at the algorithms and data
   structures that allow us to ask these questions. We'll identify different approaches to
   this problem and critique the current state of the art.

3. Observability: Modern microservices infrastructure are extremely complex. Observability
   is the process of giving visibility into the workings of this infrastructure. In
   observability, there are three main types of data: metrics, logs, and traces. The
   common dimension for all of these data is time. We will discuss the use of metrics and
   traces in Observability, what's been done in academia and industry, and what possible
   lines of research there are in the future.

## Projects

You'll also be working on projects that involve modern or even novel techniques
to address a research question. We provide a systems project, 

### Project Requirements

* Significant coding portion that implements your research
* A write up that describes what you did and how you did it, along with benchmarks or
other measurements that you use to show whether your hypothesis was verified or not.
* At end of class, we'll all have presentations. The logistics for this is still tbd

### Project options

* **Systems Project**: In this project, you will implement a TSDB in Rust. It will support
writing entries into persistent storage, reading and filtering these entries similar to a
`SELECT` with a `WHERE` clause, and simple aggregations. We will benchmark your project
using synthetic data we will make available. Details can be found
[here][100].

* **Analytics Project**: In this project, you will implement a time series
nearest-neighbor classifier. This requires finding a distance measure like Euclidean
Distance or DTW, a representation, or both, with which you find nearest neighbors of a
specific timeseries. We will benchmark your project using the UCR/UEA time series
archive. Details can be found [here][101].

### Project Assignments

You can sign-up for your project [here][102]  
Final project assignments can be found [here][103]  

## Readings

The schedule below follows the readings for every week. Although these readings are the
specifics we want to cover during the class, feel free to read more material directly
related to but not included in the readings.

### Reading summaries

**Reading Summaries** for the day's are to be submitted before class. These summaries are
pretty free-form but generally speaking we want you to compare and contrast the approaches
in each of the papers.

Submit your summaries [here][200]

### Reading assignments

During each class, two students will present on the paper readings for the week.

Sign up for your presentation preference [here][104]  
Final presentation assignments can be found [here][103]
