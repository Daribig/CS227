# Everything is a Time Series

## What this class is about
Yes. Just as it's all just bits and bytes, it's all just time series also. This
class will be about modern Time Series Management Systems (TSMS) and the
current research around this area. It will focus on three topics that give you
an overview of the landscape:

1. Time Series Storage: We'll read about storage engines used in industry and
   and proposed in academia. The fundamental problems of time series storage:
   how to store so much data, how long to store the data, and how much of the
   data store? We'll learn about how different storage engines address the
   problem and compare their approaches, benefits, and drawbacks.

2. Time Series Similarity Search: Given some short time series, can we find the
   most similar segment(s) of a larger time series? We'll take a look at the
   algorithms and data structures that allow us to ask these questions. We'll
   identify different approaches to this problem and critique the current state
   of the art.

3. Streams and Modern Hardware: Before a time series is a time series, it's
   first a stream. Streams run the internet, your GPS device, and your bank
   account. We'll learn how industry deals with massive streams in their
   distributed infrastructure. We'll also contrast the current state of the art
   with what could be given considerations of modern hardware.
