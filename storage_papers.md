Alot of these are what we are going to be reviewing in class. However, we'll be
doing more paper-finding as the project goes along.

* [Gorilla: A Fast, Scalable, In-Memory Time Series Database][7]
* [Sprintz: Time Series Compression for the Internet of Things][27]
* [BTrDB: Optimizing Storage System Design for Time Series Processing][8]

These papers are not timeseries specific and are here to give you some
background on storage for the metadata associated with timeseries

* [The TileDB Array Data Storage Manager][24]
* [Optimal Column Layout for Hybrid Workloads][1]
* [Bitmap Indexes][2]
